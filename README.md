# *Drunken Octopus* Marlin: An Alternative (Unofficial) Firmware for LulzBot Printers

Hello. My name is Marcio. I was the Firmware Engineer at LulzBot prior to the massive [layoff of 2019] that decimated the staff and left nearly one hundred people out of a job.

At the time I was let go, I was a [major contributor] to the upcoming version of Marlin, Marlin 2.0.

When Marlin 2.0 comes out, it will bring a host of new features and benefits. But ensuring Marlin 2.0 remains compatible with LulzBot printers requires someone to work with the Marlin developers so that they know our needs. During my nearly three years at LulzBot, I developed a close working relationship with several Marlin developers and helped make sure LulzBot printers were always well supported.

I've set up *Drunken Octopus* Marlin to continue that work of making sure users of LulzBot printers will not be left behind.

## Who can benefit from *Drunken Octopus* Marlin?

This firmware is for users who want the very latest firmware and features for their LulzBot printers and **are willing to take the risks associated with running development firmware**. It is also for people who want to modify or upgrade their LulzBot printers.

LulzBot made a conservative decision of keeping most customers on older but internally tested firmware. They turned off certain features for the comfort of new users. On the contrary, *Drunken Octopus* will charge right ahead, taking it all in, because that is how he likes to roll! :sunglasses:

## *Drunken Octopus* comes in up to 196 different flavors!

If you are savvy with electrical and mechanical things, *Drunken Octopus* will give you the software to match any hardware upgrades you make to your printer. See the [FAQ] for a complete list of supported printers and upgrades!

# How can you help make *Drunken Octopus* a success?

:heart: :heart: :heart: **To help me the most, please consider contributions via my [Patreon page]**. :heart: :heart: :heart:

Working on Marlin used to be a paid, full-time job for me, but without LulzBot to support me, I will have
to work on my own time using my own resources. In exchange for your help, I hope to create content, such as printer upgrade guides and other tutorials. I learned a *ton* at the R&D department at LulzBot and I have much I want to teach you!

Even if you are unable to contribute, I can still use your help. See the [FAQ] for a list of non-monetary ways to chip in!

# License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
